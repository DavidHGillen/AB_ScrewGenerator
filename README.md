# AB_ScrewGenerator
Screw, Bolt, and Connector generation utility for use with Substance Designer/Painter

## About
Working on a model I needed to add some screws at key points to round out the detailing; however, I was unimpressed with the options I found for free, so I decided to write a general purpose utility anyone could use. While far from perfect I added features that would allow all the types of connectors I could think of. From Self tapping woodscrews, to PC Hard Drive screws, and ended up with something that could even make passable sci-fi nonsense.

This is released under MIT for anyone to do with as they will but not to the extent that I don't appreciate the credit for my work. Especially on bigger projects.

## How to install
Grab the .sbar file and import it to your substance application. I hope to do some stuff with releases and the like, but this is an initial commit. If you don't have any Substance applications then you might be able to use it with a Substance plugin for a game engine like Unreal or Unity.

## How to modify
Grab the .sbs file from the folder and do as you will.

## Features / Tutorials
TBD
